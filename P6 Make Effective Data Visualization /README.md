# P6:Make Effective Data Visualization

## Summary
In this project, I focus on visualization by using d3.js and dimple.js.
Data I used in this project is about the baseball players' performance which inclues 1157 players.
Data is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w7KhqotVi5eoKE3I_AZHbsxdr-NmcWsLTIiZrpxWx4w/pub?embedded=true)

High BMI players tend to have better batting performance.


## Design
1157 players are so many that I selected only top 60 players in the first graph.
The second and third graph, I classified batters in terms of BMI(more than 24 or not) and Handedness.

Modification
1.I added some explanation of batting average for the uninitiated.

2.I modified typo and grammatical error. I arranged the layout of HTML.

3.I changed the order of ticks of bar charts so that they are consistent.

## Feedback

1.stefan
For the uninitiated, could you explain what the batting average means and if higher or lower is better?

2.donatazuk
There are some typos and grammar mistakes that should be fixed:
“Is it a gereral trend to have”
“ Overweight players tend to be better performance”
“players are better performance in batting”
Otherwise nice job!

3.Yuki
The graphs are easy to recognize.
The only one thing I find is that the ticks in the bar charts are not consistent.
