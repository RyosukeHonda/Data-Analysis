# P6:Make Effective Data Visualization

## Summary
In this project, I focus on visualization by using d3.js and dimple.js.
Data I used in this project is about the baseball players' performance which inclues 1157 players.
Data is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w7KhqotVi5eoKE3I_AZHbsxdr-NmcWsLTIiZrpxWx4w/pub?embedded=true)


## Design
1157 players are so many that I selected only top 60 players in the first graph.
The second and third graph, I classified batters in terms of BMI(more than 24 or not) and Handedness.
